const HABIT_RATIONALE = {
  sleep_bed:      "Sleep supports training recovery, appetite regulation, and hormonal patterns relevant to muscle building. Experimental studies suggest sleep restriction reduces muscle protein synthesis and lowers testosterone, though the exact size of these effects varies between studies. Consistently getting 7 to 9 hours is the recommendation with the strongest evidence base for active men. Evidence quality: moderate to strong.",
  sleep_wake:     "Consistent wake time is one of the more reliable anchors for circadian rhythm stability. This stabilizes sleep architecture over time and supports consistent hormonal patterns. Evidence quality: moderate.",
  sleep_caffeine: "Caffeine has a half-life of roughly 5 to 6 hours. A 2013 controlled study found caffeine taken 6 hours before bed reduced total sleep by approximately one hour. Individual metabolism varies considerably. Evidence quality: moderate.",
  sleep_morning:  "Morning light exposure helps regulate circadian timing, which supports sleep quality and consistent sleep patterns. Most supporting studies are small. The habit also adds low-intensity movement. Evidence quality: moderate.",
  nutr_protein:   "Protein is the primary nutritional lever for body recomposition. Research supports roughly 0.7 to 1g per pound of bodyweight for people combining resistance training with fat loss goals. A randomized trial by Longland et al. (2016) found that higher protein intake during an energy deficit combined with exercise led to greater lean mass gain and more fat loss than lower protein intake. The ISSN position stand (2017) supports 1.4 to 2.0g per kg per day for exercising individuals. Evidence quality: strong.",
  nutr_heart:     "Heart-healthy eating for high cholesterol primarily means limiting saturated fat, which raises LDL, avoiding processed meats, and increasing plant foods and fiber. The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to less than 6% of total calories for people following a heart-healthy pattern. Evidence for dietary saturated fat and LDL is strong and consistent across decades of research. Examples: olive oil instead of butter, lean or plant proteins, plenty of vegetables.",
  nutr_fiber:     "Soluble fiber (found in oats, beans, lentils, psyllium, barley, apples, chia, flaxseed) reduces LDL cholesterol through bile acid binding in the gut. A 2023 meta-analysis of 181 RCTs found soluble fiber supplementation reduced LDL by an average of 8.28 mg/dL. Each additional 5g per day reduced LDL by approximately 5.57 mg/dL. Evidence quality: strong.",
  nutr_lunch:     "Protein and vegetable-centred meals support satiety, provide fiber and micronutrients, and reduce reliance on refined carbohydrates. Evidence for meal composition effects on satiety is reasonably consistent.",
  nutr_dinner:    "Same logic as lunch. Ending the day with protein and plants fits within a heart-healthy pattern and supports muscle protein synthesis overnight.",
  nutr_omega3:    "Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) reliably reduce triglycerides, a cardiovascular risk factor alongside cholesterol. Evidence for triglyceride reduction is strong. Evidence for direct LDL reduction is weaker and inconsistent. Good food sources include salmon, sardines, mackerel, trout, chia seeds, flaxseed, and walnuts. Evidence quality: strong for triglycerides, moderate for other cardiovascular outcomes.",
  nutr_alcohol:   "Alcohol raises triglycerides, disrupts sleep architecture, and contributes calories without nutritional value relevant to body recomposition. Regular consumption is linked to increased cancer risk in observational research. Evidence quality: strong for sleep and triglycerides.",
  nutr_no_eat:    "The goal is not fasting for its own sake -- it is making evening food intake intentional rather than reactive. Randomized trials comparing time-restricted eating to standard calorie management show mixed results. The practical benefit is likely reducing unplanned snacking. Evidence quality: mixed for metabolic benefits, reasonable for reducing unplanned intake.",
  nutr_no_junk:   "Processed meats are classified as Group 1 carcinogens by WHO IARC, meaning there is sufficient evidence of a link to colorectal cancer. This classification reflects strength of evidence, not that absolute risk is large. Regular daily consumption is what the evidence flags. Processed meats also tend to be high in sodium and saturated fat, relevant for cardiovascular health.",
  nutr_nuts:      "Nuts and legumes are associated with lower cardiovascular risk in large observational studies. They provide fiber, plant protein, healthy fats, and minerals. A serving of nuts daily is part of several evidence-based heart-healthy dietary patterns including the Mediterranean diet. Evidence quality: moderate to strong from observational research.",
  train_plan:     "Resistance training is the foundation of body recomposition. It stimulates muscle protein synthesis, increases lean mass, raises resting metabolic rate, and improves insulin sensitivity. ACSM recommends training each muscle group 2 to 3 times per week for hypertrophy, with at least 48 hours between sessions for the same muscle groups. Progressive overload -- gradually increasing load or volume -- is necessary for continued adaptation. Rest days are part of the plan. Evidence quality: very strong.",
  train_movement: "Low-intensity movement throughout the day (sometimes called NEAT -- non-exercise activity thermogenesis) contributes to total daily energy expenditure and cardiovascular health independently of structured exercise. A daily walk or movement snack adds activity without meaningfully impairing recovery from strength training. Evidence quality: moderate.",
  train_cardio:   "Cardiovascular exercise supports heart health, improves VO2 max, and helps manage triglycerides and blood pressure. It is complementary to strength training for body recomposition but secondary to it for muscle building specifically. Evidence quality: strong for cardiovascular health.",
  train_mobility: "Regular mobility work supports joint health, movement quality, and injury prevention. Injury prevention protects training consistency, which is the variable that matters most over time. Evidence for specific hypertrophy benefits is limited. Evidence quality: moderate for injury prevention.",
  train_easy:     "Light movement on rest days supports blood flow, reduces muscle soreness, and keeps daily activity levels consistent. Evidence is modest -- the main benefit is staying active without accumulating training fatigue. Evidence quality: limited.",
  rec_outside:    "Time in natural environments is associated with lower self-reported stress and improved mood in multiple observational studies. Effect sizes are modest. Evidence quality: moderate, primarily observational.",
  rec_stress:     "Chronic psychological stress raises cortisol, which at sustained elevated levels can impair recovery and hormonal health. Stress management is a supporting factor for body recomposition rather than a primary driver. Evidence quality: moderate.",
  rec_me:         "Maintaining activities outside of work or obligations supports mental health and long-term habit sustainability. Evidence is primarily from wellbeing research.",
  rec_task:       "A sense of agency and progress outside primary obligations is associated with lower chronic stress in observational research.",

      <div class="modal-title">How Root works</div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">The daily check-in</div>
        <p>Open the Today screen and tap habits as you complete them throughout the day. Each check-off earns points immediately and habits reset at midnight. If you forget to log a day, use the "Log a past day" button at the bottom of the Today screen -- you can go back up to 7 days and check off anything you actually did. The goal is to make this a 60-second interaction, not a planning session.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">Your core habits and bonus habits</div>
        <p>Six habits are marked as core commitments: followed training plan, hit protein target, heart-healthy plate, soluble fiber, in bed by target time, and movement floor. Completing at least five of those six is what counts as a streak day. Everything else on your list is a bonus habit. Bonus habits still earn points and contribute to your domain bars -- they just don't affect the streak.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">Understanding your domain bars</div>
        <p>Your habits feed into four domains: Sleep, Nutrition, Training, and Recovery. The domain bars on the This Week screen fill based on your completions for the week so far, measured against days elapsed rather than all seven days -- so on a Tuesday, you're compared against two days of possible habits, not a full week. A few habits cross domains: mobility work counts toward both Training and Recovery.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">The streak system</div>
        <p>Your streak counts consecutive days where you completed at least five of your six core habits. One grace day per calendar week is built in -- if you miss a day, the streak survives as long as it's the only miss that week. The streak counter appears on the Today screen once you have a streak of 1 or more days. Milestones at 7, 21, 66, 90, 180, and 365 days are tracked in the Progress screen and earn badges permanently -- breaking a streak never removes a badge you've already earned.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">The savings bar and rewards</div>
        <p>Set a specific reward goal -- something you want to buy or experience. Every point earns toward your goal, and when the bar fills you tap "Cash out." The idea is simple: you commit to not buying that thing until you've earned it, and the app tracks the permission. Past goals are saved in your rewards history on the Progress screen.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">Logging exercise</div>
        <p>On the Exercise screen, tap "Log a workout" and choose an activity, duration, and intensity. Checking the strength training habit on Today will prompt the workout log automatically. Strength training sessions are marked as priority because resistance training preserves lean muscle mass during weight loss. The Exercise screen shows your weekly totals and full workout history.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">Reading your progress</div>
        <p>The Progress screen shows your full weight history with a smoothed trend line overlaid -- the trend is what to watch, not individual weeks. Milestone markers show your first 5 and 10 lbs lost and whether you've reached your goal range. If you switch to maintenance mode after reaching your goal, the target line changes to a shaded band showing your maintenance range. The Progress screen also shows your streak history, earned badges, and any optional tracking you have turned on.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">Optional features</div>
        <p>Five optional features are available under Settings -- Optional Features. Sleep tracking adds a morning card to log your estimated sleep window and shows a bar chart over time. The mood, energy, and motivation log adds a daily check-in with pattern charts on the Progress screen. Progress photos lets you capture a monthly photo and view them as a timeline. Measurement tracking records body measurements monthly with a line graph. Notifications let you set up to four optional reminders including streak protection, weigh-in nudge, bedtime reminder, and a morning check-in. All optional features are off by default and can be turned on or off at any time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section">
        <div class="how-heading">Customizing your habits</div>
        <p>In Settings you can toggle any habit on or off, rename items to match your own language, adjust point values, and add custom habits to any domain. The activity menu for workouts is fully editable. Core habits will ask for confirmation before being removed since they affect the streak calculation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-section" style="border-bottom:none">
        <div class="how-heading">Your data and backup</div>
        <p>Everything is stored locally on your device -- no account, no server, no one else can see it. Use Export Data in Settings regularly to download a backup. If your browser cache is ever cleared, that backup is the only way to restore your history. Google Sheets sync is also available under Settings -- Data if you want a live copy of your data automatically backed up to your own Google Drive.</p>
